# keeptrace

KeepState is a repo where I save info about my technical studies.

# Why?

Beginning of 2022, I started to publish the result of my work on Grafana and Github Action in linkedin.
I discover the pleasure to share the result of my work and I was thinking to a different way to do it.

# Why on github?

I'm always on this platform for my work or for my personal projects and I think it's the best place to share things.

# Where are the info?

Initially started on a wiki github, now keeptrace is using Github Page and Jekyllrb

# What is the advantage?

There are multiple advantages:

- I can create/edit a page online (via the github website).
- I can create/edit a page offline
- It's automatically deployed after a commit
- Markdown is easy to use.
