# keeptrace

KeepState is a repo where I save info about my technical study.

# Why?

Beginning of 2022, i start to publish the result of my work on Grafana and Github Action in linkedin.
I discover the pleasure to share the result of my work and I was thinking to a different way to do it.

# Why on github?

I'm always on this platform for my work or for my personal projects and I think it's the best place to share things.

# Where are the info?

For now, in the wiki of this project.

# What is the advantage?

There are multiple advantages:

- I can create/edit a page online.
- I can clone the wiki and work offline if needed (the wiki's managed like any repo).
- No need to learn how to use another platform and the Markdown integration in github is enough for what i want to do.

# Ok and now?
