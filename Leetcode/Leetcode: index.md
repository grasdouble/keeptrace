In this category, I will share solutions on some scenarios solved on Leetcode and explain them.

# Leetcode

It's a platform where you can play with a large list of scenario to solve in the language that you want (not sure all are there but the most popular for sure)

You can use it to prepare a technical interview but not only.

Each time you solved a scenario, you will see its performance and a comparison with other submissions.
