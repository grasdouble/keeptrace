There are already lot of info available about cypress.

I will focus only on the most important things for me.

1. Not try to do atomic test with it.
   > you will lose time to do them and lose time during execution.
2. No need to create another layer on top of Cypress.
   > Most of the time, the functions provided by Cypress are sufficient.
3. The function wait exist but you should not use it.
   > it will impact the time of execution and will not necessarly do your tests more stable.
